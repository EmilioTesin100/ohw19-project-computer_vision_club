#### The Problem

Annotating imagery data by hand is time consuming, mundane and costly which is only exacerbated with larger datasets. What if you could use AI to help you with the brunt of the workload, leaving you with the simple task of going over its predictions and ensuring it is correct?

This project aims to use benthic habitat imagery data collected from ROVs to train a deep object recognition algorithm. With a learned model, its task will then be used to make predictions on non-annotated data. Predictions with high enough confidences will be retained as per the users discretion.

### Workflow at a glance:

1.) Parsing/cleaning existing annotation data   __complete__
2.) Extracting and organizing training data   __complete__
3.) Preprocessing and augmenting training data   
4.) Train object recognition/image classification network  
5.) Apply trained model to new data, take *good* predictions and add to training data  

#### Application example

#### Specific tasks

The current task:  

Everyone should have access to the most updated version of 'jordan_scrap_notebook' and the results/sample/... data that Massimo organized. With these you can now start your own training process! :)

What you need to do is change the configure file which in the script, is a class titled `TrainConfig()`

[Here](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) is the link to the repo that we're using, if you need help, find what you need in the tutorials under the section __Getting Started__

[Here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-train-an-object-detection-model-with-keras/) is the link to the Kangaroo tutorial. Jordan's script is almost the same exact code. If you don't understand why Jordan did what he did, read this!  

Last but not least, download Massimo's [data!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_FanEMUwS2qT6w9i0sUR_FyYhh4P8IB/view?usp=sharing).

[This](https://gist.github.com/21c99f12f286cb84f6abd025d299a800) is how the data was prepared!

__Make sure to put the data in your local machine, unzip it, and edit Jordan's script to work with it (change the source variable)__

#### Existing methods
